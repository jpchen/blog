## Pre-recruiting

-   Harvard buys ACT/SAT scores from Collegeboard. Encourages the top ~100,000 to apply.
	- This has no effect on actual admission
-   Harvard buys “information” of high school students of all races, minorities, and “sparse country” (20 midwestern/southern states). They specifically recruit minority students through Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program. Low income students are encouraged to apply for fin aid.
